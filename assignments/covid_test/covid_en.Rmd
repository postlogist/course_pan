A manufacturer of a test for COVID-19 antibodies claims the following 
test characteristics: 

Testing for IgG antibodies (a person has immunity to COVID):

Specificity = 96.4%
Sensitivity = 91.8%


Testing for IgM antibodies (a person has active COVID infection)

Specificity = 97.3%
Sensitivity = 95.7%

Let's consider a case for IgM testing. 
What will be the result of testing 100 000 people with this test. 
Assume that about 2% of population are currently infected.

How many infected people will be detected?
How many people will be incorrectly detected as infected (false positives)?
How many healthy people will get a correct test result?
How many infected people will the test miss?
