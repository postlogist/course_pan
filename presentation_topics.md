**Demand forecasting for the beverage industry using multi-tiered causal analysis**
Explain the approach to forecasting demand in the beverage industry based on sales data, POS data and inventory levels.
Why such an approach is important for the beverage industry? How are the different kinds of data combined to produce a forecast? What is demand sensing and demand shaping? How was the model used for demand shaping?
What are the steps of the MTCA approach? What methods are used for data analysis and forecasting? What are the key predictors in the forecasting model? How can the validity of the model be tested?

**Analysis and forecasting of demand during promotions for perishable items**

The paper presents the empirical results of modeling demand for perishable items in the retail environment. Analyse the approach used by the authors and provide an overview of the models they tried.  What factors appeared to be useful to predict demand?  Are these factors available when using the models in the real business environment? How the introduction of non-linear terms and interactions between predictors influenced the model's accuracy? How did the authors select the best model?
